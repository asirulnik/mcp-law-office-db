Regarding the approved IEE for Heaven Sampson, please arrange to have the evaluation conducted by James Levine & Associates, one of the independent evaluators you suggested at our 6/12/24 meeting.   

We request a comprehensive IEE focusing on the following areas:

1. A thorough assessment of Heaven's Emotional Disability, including:
a. Its impact on her ability to access and benefit from the general curriculum
b. How it affects her social, emotional, and academic development
c. Its influence on her school attendance and engagement
d. How it affects her ability to make progress on standardized, criterion-referenced, or curriculum-based assessments
e. Its impact on her potential to progress to the next grade level
f. The potential impact of 16 minutes per week of school-based counseling, and whether this level of service is likely to be sufficient given Heaven's needs

2. An evaluation of Heaven's current academic functioning across all subject areas, with particular attention to:
a. Any discrepancies between her cognitive abilities and academic achievement
b. The relationship between her emotional state and academic performance
c. A suspected Specific Learning Disability in mathematics (given her Very Low score (78) in Math Computation on the WRAT-5)

3. An assessment of Heaven's social-emotional functioning, including:
a. Peer relationships and social skills
b. Emotional regulation and coping strategies (in light of her Clinically Significant scores in Somatization and Anxiety on the BASC-3)
c. Self-esteem and self-efficacy in the school setting

4. An evaluation of Heaven's executive functioning skills, with particular focus on her Working Memory, which was identified as an area of weakness (WMI: 82) on the WISC-V

5. An evaluation of Heaven's progress in relation to:
a. Chronological age and developmental expectations
b. Her individual educational potential
c. The learning standards set forth in the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks and the district's curriculum

6. An analysis of whether Heaven requires related services, such as counseling and specialized transportation, to access the general curriculum in a way that allows her to develop her full educational potential. This analysis should include:
a. An assessment of Heaven's ability to progress effectively in the general education program with and without these related services
b. How these services would impact Heaven's ability to make documented growth in the acquisition of knowledge and skills, including social/emotional development
c. Whether these services are necessary for Heaven to access the general curriculum in a way that allows her to develop her potential, including social/emotional development
d. The potential impact on Heaven's educational progress if these services were not provided
e. An assessment of the potential impact and adequacy of the offered but not yet implemented counseling services (20 min/month), given Heaven's current needs and challenges

7. Detailed recommendations for:
a. Evidence-based interventions to address identified areas of need
b. Accommodations and modifications to support Heaven's full participation in the general education setting
c. School-based counseling or psychologist services that may be necessary for Heaven to access and benefit from her education, including:
i. Specific type of counseling or other services needed
ii. Frequency and duration of each recommended service
iii. Minimum qualifications and experience of the recommended service provider(s)
iv. Any additional services or supports that may be necessary for Heaven to access the general curriculum in a manner that allows her to develop her full educational potential
v. Goals and objectives for each recommended service

8. An analysis of whether and how the recommended services and supports are necessary for Heaven to develop her full educational potential

In addition, the evaluation should assess Heaven's ability to demonstrate the following skills from the 2023 Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Comprehensive Health and Physical Education:

Practice 2: Self-management and Goal Setting
- Strategies to effectively manage changing emotions during adolescence (8.2.MH.2)
- Techniques to independently manage emotions in a variety of settings (8.2.MH.4)

- Ways to show courtesy and respect for others when aspects of their identity differ from one's own (8.7.SH.1)

Please ensure that the evaluator is provided all relevant school records, including recent evaluations, the FBA, attendance records, and academic performance data.

It is essential that the evaluation include in-person observations of Heaven in the school setting, particularly given her variable attendance and performance across different classes.

Please copy me on all correspondence with the independent evaluator, as these form part of Heaven's student record in relation to special education.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you for your continued support for Heaven.

I must correct my previous email. I just spoke with Ms. Sampson, who clarified several critical points:

1. Uber's policies prohibit unaccompanied minors from riding. This morning, Ms. Sampson had to accompany Heaven to school herself, while a relative was able to provide transportation home.
2. As a direct result of having to escort Heaven to school, Ms. Sampson received a disciplinary reprimand at work for tardiness.
3. Ms. Sampson cannot afford to advance transportation costs. Unless the District makes special arrangements for Heaven to be transported, Heaven will not be able to get to school.

The District's offer to reimburse transportation costs does not address these barriers to Heaven's school access. Please advise immediately how the District will provide Heaven's transportation to and from school, beginning tomorrow (Thursday) until regular bus service begins.

To be clear, we expect the District to ensure Heaven's transportation to and from school tomorrow, by whatever means necessary, including District staff using personal vehicles if required, assuming Ms. Sampson is comfortable with the specifics of that arrangement.

Ms. Sampson can be reached directly at 413-219-7233 by phone or text to confirm and coordinate logistics in the morning.

Re: Heaven S. v. Springfield Public Schools (BSEA #2414829)
        URGENT - Material Breach of Settlement Agreement

Dear Attorney St. Florian:

I write regarding the District's failure to implement the most basic elements of our settlement agreement on Heaven's first day at Renaissance School.  These failures constitute an immediate and material breach of the agreement that formed the basis for our joint motion to dismiss.

Despite the agreement's explicit requirement that the school change occur ""upon full execution"" and having over a week since signing, the District failed to:
1.	Notify the bus company of Heaven's school change
2.	Arrange transportation to and from school
3.	Transfer Heaven's educational records to Renaissance
4.	Respond to urgent communications about these issues

As detailed in my 12:25 PM email today, Heaven and her mother waited for Bus 68 this morning, but no bus arrived.  The bus company reports that no one advised them of Heaven's school change and states it will take up to five days to implement the change.  Ms. Sampson, who does not have access to a car and whose work schedule does not permit her to transport Heaven herself, was forced to arrange an Uber to take Heaven to school at her own expense of $14.00.  While Ms. Sampson has managed to arrange alternate transportation home for today through a relative, this is not a sustainable solution.

Additionally, no school records other than Heaven's IEP have been made available to Renaissance staff.  While Renaissance staff made commendable efforts to welcome Heaven this morning despite the lack of necessary records, this situation constitutes a clear breach of the settlement terms.

This latest failure continues a documented pattern of delays and non-responsiveness that has characterized this entire matter:

1.	Initial Child Find Violations (January-April 2024):
-	District expressly acknowledged Heaven's disability-related attendance barriers at least 11 months ago
-	Took no action to evaluate or provide services for over four months
-	Only initiated evaluation process after mother retained counsel who made the April 7 referral

2.	Eligibility Determination Delays (June-August 2024), depriving Heaven of services during summer school and start of year
-	District refused to find Heaven eligible on June 12 despite meeting criteria
-	Reversed determination on August 29 without any new evaluations

3.	IEP Development and Implementation Delays:
-	Failed to provide timely IEP after August 29 eligibility determination
-	October 23 communications regarding proposed IEP went unanswered until November 1
-	Two weeks passed after November 19 request for IEP/safety plan corrections with no response
-	Still no timeline for IEE approved five months ago

4.	Settlement Process Delays:
-	Multiple requests for Heaven to visit Renaissance School went unanswered
-	Basic logistical arrangements that could have been made weeks ago were ignored
-	Critical communications about planning for Heaven’s transition to Renaissance received no response

5.	As of this writing, we have received no response our urgent email of earlier today. :
-	Transportation plan for Heaven beginning tomorrow morning
-	Timeline for implementing regular bus service 
-	Timeline for complete transfer of Heaven's records to Renaissance
-	Reimbursement for Ms. Sampson's Uber expense

While I appreciate our conversation earlier today about addressing these issues, the bus company's proposed five-day implementation timeline is unacceptable and effectively nullifies the settlement agreement's core purpose.  Heaven cannot be expected to miss school or rely on expensive rideshare services that her family can ill afford while waiting for basic transportation services to be implemented.

The impact of these ongoing delays is particularly egregious given Heaven's documented severe anxiety about school transitions, the District's knowledge of Ms. Sampson's inability to provide transportation, the critical importance of consistent attendance to Heaven's educational progress, and the District's pattern of delays throughout this matter dating back to January 2024

If we do not receive a concrete plan addressing these issues by tomorrow morning, I will seek Ms. Sampson’s approval to file an emergency motion to withdraw our assent to the joint motion to dismiss.  A draft of this motion is attached as a courtesy.

We cannot allow Heaven to continue to be denied access to her education due to the District's continued pattern of implementation failures and non-responsiveness.

I look forward to a prompt response with a concrete plan for tomorrow.


Very truly yours,

Andrew Sirulnik, Esq.

Student v. Springfield Public Schools 
BSEA #2414829
MOTION TO WITHDRAW ASSENT
TO JOINT MOTION TO DISMISS [DRAFT]
NOW COMES the Student, through counsel, and hereby moves this Honorable Hearing Officer to allow withdrawal of Student's assent to the pending Joint Motion to Dismiss based on the District's immediate and material breach of the settlement agreement that formed the basis for the motion. As grounds therefore, Student states:
1.	On December 9, 2024, the parties executed a settlement agreement resolving this matter.

2.	The agreement specifically provided that ""Upon full execution of this Agreement, the District agrees to change the Student's assignment to the Renaissance Middle School."" The agreement's core provisions thus required the District to:
(1)	Change Heaven's school placement to Renaissance School;
(2)	Provide transportation to the new placement;  
(3)	Transfer Heaven's educational records to Renaissance; and
(4)	Implement these changes immediately upon signing.

3.	On December 13, 2024, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Dismiss this matter with prejudice.

4.	The District's implementation failures were evident immediately. Despite our December 12 urgent email requesting specific transition information including:
(1)	The specific transition plan
(2)	Her designated point of contact at Renaissance
(3)	Transition and transportation logistics  
(4)	Timing and location for initial meetings
5.	The District provided only minimal bus information on December 13, and failed to respond to our immediate follow-up request that same day for staff contact information.

6.	On December 16, 2024, Heaven's first day at Renaissance:
(1)	No transportation was provided;
(2)	The bus company reported that no one had informed them of Heaven's school change;
(3)	The bus company stated it would take up to five days to implement the change;
(4)	No school records other than Heaven's IEP had been transferred to Renaissance staff.

7.	Heaven's mother was forced to arrange private transportation at personal expense ($14.00 for Uber) to ensure Heaven could attend school. While she managed to secure alternate transportation home through a relative for the first day, this is not a sustainable solution.

8.	Despite notice of these issues by email at 12:25 PM on December 17, 2024, requesting confirmation of:
(1)	Transportation arrangements beginning tomorrow
(2)	Timeline for implementing regular bus service
(3)	Timeline for complete transfer of Heaven's records
(4)	Reimbursement for Ms. Sampson's Uber expense

9.	The District has failed to respond or take any corrective action.

10.	The District's pattern of non-responsiveness and delays has characterized this entire matter:
•	Initial Child Find Violations (January-April 2024):’
1.	District expressly acknowledged Heaven's disability-related attendance barriers at least 11 months ago
2.	Took no action to evaluate or provide services for over four months
3.	Only initiated evaluation process after mother retained counsel who made the April 7 referral
•	Eligibility Determination Delays (June-August 2024), depriving Heaven of services during summer school and start of year:
4.	District refused to find Heaven eligible on June 12 despite meeting criteria
5.	Reversed determination on August 29 without any new evaluations

•	IEP Development and Implementation Delays:
6.	Failed to provide timely IEP after August 29 eligibility determination
7.	October 23 communications regarding proposed IEP went unanswered until November 1
8.	Two weeks passed after November 19 request for IEP/safety plan corrections with no response
9.	Still no timeline for IEE approved five months ago

•	Settlement Process Delays:
10.	Multiple requests for Heaven to visit Renaissance School went unanswered
11.	Basic logistical arrangements that could have been made weeks ago were ignored
12.	Critical communications about planning for Heaven's transition to Renaissance received no response

This current breach is particularly egregious given:
•	Heaven's documented severe anxiety about school transitions ;
•	The District's knowledge of Ms. Sampson's inability to provide transportation;
•	The critical importance of consistent attendance to Heaven's educational progress;
•	The District's pattern of delays throughout this matter dating back to January 2024.
•	The five-day implementation timeline proposed by the bus company effectively nullifies the settlement agreement's core purpose of providing immediate access to appropriate education.

2.	Pursuant to Paragraph 8 of the Settlement Agreement, the agreement was ""intended to take effect as a sealed instrument upon execution by all parties,"" making the District's obligations immediately binding upon signing on December 9, 2024.

3.	Given the impact on Student's daily access to education and the unsustainability of current temporary transportation arrangements, expedited consideration of this motion is warranted.

4.	WHEREFORE, Student respectfully requests that this Honorable Hearing Officer:

A.	ALLOW Student to withdraw her assent to the Joint Motion to Dismiss;

B.	DENY the Joint Motion to Dismiss;

C.	GRANT expedited consideration of this motion; and

D.	Grant such other relief as the Hearing Officer deems appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,
Student

Heaven and her mother waited outside their apartment for Bus 68 this morning, but no bus arrived. Ms. Sampson, who does not have access to a car and whose work schedule does not permit her to transport Heaven herself, urgently arranged for an Uber to take Heaven to school at her own expense of $14.00.  The bus company reports that no one advised them of Heaven's school change, and states it will take up to five days to implement the change.  As a result, Heaven effectively will be denied access to school until the bus company can implement the change.  Additionally, no school records other than Heaven's IEP have been made available to Renaissance staff.

We note that your client had the time and inclination to contact the juvenile court to clarify my authority to represent Heaven, but not to ensure fulfillment of its basic obligations under the terms of the settlement agreement that it confirmed last week.

While Renaissance staff made commendable efforts to welcome Heaven this morning despite the lack of necessary records, this situation constitutes a prospective material breach of the settlement terms.  Ms. Sampson has attempted to mitigate damages by sending Heaven to school with a rideshare service, but is not in a financial position to pay for Heaven's transportation to and from school, or risk termination from her job for missing work to transport Heaven, nor should your client expect her to.

We require confirmation by 1:00 PM today of:
•	Transportation arrangements for Heaven's return home today
•	Interim transportation plan until regular bus service begins
•	Timeline for complete transfer of Heaven's records to Renaissance
•	Reimbursement for Ms. Sampson's Uber expense this morning

Please advise immediately how your client will facilitate Heaven’s transportation home from school this afternoon, and to school and home until the bus company begins regular service.

In my December 16, 2024 9:31 AM email to Ms. Scott-Smith, I indicated that I was ""Heaven's court-appointed education attorney"", but I was mistaken.

Heaven's absence from Renaissance today due to what appears to be physical illness highlights why we are pursuing this separate track regarding medical evaluation. While we've secured the James Levine neuropsychological evaluation through our settlement to assess suspected math disability and emotional functioning, Heaven's repeated absences from physical symptoms - some apparently distinct from her ED classification for anxiety - raise concerns that require medical assessment to ensure appropriate educational programming.

As you know, a settlement agreement regarding specific evaluations and IEP provisions does not restrict a student's ongoing right to request additional evaluations under IDEA and state law, particularly in disability areas not addressed in prior IEP meetings, the settlement, or the agreed-upon IEP. This medical evaluation request addresses a distinct area of suspected disability that wasn't at issue in the prior dispute or part of our settlement discussions.

Ms. Sampson has been diligently pursuing comprehensive medical evaluation through insurance, including a pending pre-authorization request with Baystate. However, given the persistent insurance barriers she's faced (which also led to the loss of Heaven's outside counselor) and the direct impact of these undiagnosed conditions on Heaven's education, the school's independent obligation under G.L. c. 71B § 3 to conduct necessary medical assessments has been triggered. When I learned today of Heaven's absence this first day she was expected to attend Renaissance, combined with the continued pre-authorization delays, I advised Ms. Sampson to initiate the school-based evaluation process in parallel to avoid further delays in identifying and addressing these barriers to Heaven's education.

I hope this answers the question.

I am Heaven's court-appointed education attorney through the Springfield Juvenile Court. Heaven's mother, Samantha Sampson, Matthew Dias and Debra Szostkiewicz, are copied here. Attorneys Dias and Szostkiewicz are Heaven's and her mother's attorneys, respectively. My order of appointment and Ms. Sampson's ROI for me are in Heaven's file. Heaven has an IEP under the disability category of Emotional Disability, specifically manifesting as severe anxiety that substantially interferes with her school attendance and participation. Her IEP includes various supports and weekly sessions with a school adjustment counselor. In addition to her emotional disability, Heaven experiences significant physical health symptoms that severely impact her attendance. While some symptoms may be anxiety-related, she frequently suffers from infections and potentially has cardiological issues. The underlying causes remain undiagnosed, as health insurance limitations have prevented comprehensive medical evaluation. Given that these physical conditions directly interfere with Heaven's access to education, we request that the school arrange a comprehensive multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation as part of her IEP process. While medical evaluations are typically arranged and funded through parents' health insurance, schools have a parallel obligation under IDEA and Massachusetts special education law. Specifically, G.L. c. 71B § 3 requires ""a complete medical assessment by a physician... and assessments by such specialists as may be required in accordance with the diagnosis including when necessary, but not limited to an assessment by a neurologist, an audiologist, an ophthalmologist … and a psychiatrist"" when these areas potentially limit a student's educational progress. Additionally, we request an IEP meeting be convened as soon as possible to discuss the implementation of Heaven's current IEP. I look forward to working with you to support Heaven.

I need to respond to the suggestion that Heaven's current lack of services stems from our actions rather than the district's documented pattern of delays.  Let me review the timeline:
1.	The district first acknowledged Heaven's disability-related barriers to attendance no later than January 11, 2024, yet took no steps to evaluate her or provide mandated services.
2.	On June 12, 2024, the district refused to find Heaven eligible despite having completed its evaluation.
3.	On August 29, 2024, the district reversed its eligibility determination without any new evaluations - suggesting that it was the initial denial that was unreasonable, not our pursuit of services.
4.	This 2.5-month delay deprived Heaven of special education services during summer school and the start of this school year.
5.	Even after finding Heaven eligible, the district failed to provide a timely IEP, causing further delays.
6.	The pattern continues:
i.	Our October 23 communications concerning the proposed IEP received no response until November 1
ii.	Two weeks have passed since our November 19 request for two straightforward corrections to the safety plan and IEP, but the email remains unanswered
iii.	There is no timeline yet for the IEE the district approved in June
7.	On November 25, the district sent us a signed agreement without addressing our requested clarifications.  The district now states we ""cannot make edits to an agreement, sign it and expect us to accept it,"" having ignored our request for corrections, drafted an agreement, signed it, and expected us to accept it.
8.	Having received no response to our November 19 requests, on December 4 we moved forward with signing, adding only two factual corrections do not alter any substantive terms:
i.	Documenting Heaven's loss of outside counseling
ii.	Correcting the Heaven’s diagnosis listed on the Safety Plan, per a mental health provider’s documentation that Ms. Sampson supplied to the district months ago.
To resolve this efficiently, I ask that you please:
1.	Review and confirm our factual corrections
2.	Provide fully executed copies
3.	Begin implementing Heaven's school reassignment and services immediately

Thank you.

First, I want to express our appreciation for the thoughtful approach taken in drafting the proposed IEP. We appreciate the careful consideration given to Heaven's situation. Attached please find our requested changes to the proposed IEP. To summarize, we are requesting: 1. Social-emotional goals: Per our October 10 resolution meeting discussions, further breaking down the broad social-emotional goal into four specific, measurable components that are essential to Heaven's ability succeed at school: • Morning anxiety management • In-school anxiety regulation • School attendance • Self-awareness and self-management 2. Service delivery modifications: • As discussed, adding home/outside provider consultation time to the A-Grid • Adding the agreed formalized check-in protocols • Including Heaven's agreed participation in the weekly ""Trails to Wellness"" group 3. Enhanced accommodations: • Ensuring full implementation of the agreed card system across all classes (as discussed at meeting) • Adding flexible arrival times • Structured break protocols and checks-ins, as discussed • Formal reintegration plan following absences While we do understand that some of these protocols and procedures could be included in a separate safety plan, we believe they should be incorporated into the IEP itself as they are directly related to Heaven's disability and IEP goals. Including them in the IEP would ensure consistent implementation, clear accountability, and proper monitoring of their use and effectiveness as part of Heaven's overall special education program. 4. Modifications to service delivery: At our October 10 resolution meeting, we agreed to 20 minutes per week of school counseling based on Heaven receiving weekly 45-minute therapy sessions at school from Nicole Dean (CHD). Unfortunately, we have since learned that Heaven has lost access to Ms. Dean due to insurance issues. Given Heaven's significant mental health care needs and their impact on her ability to go to school and sustain emotional regulation when she is in school, this is a concerning development. While Ms. Sampson is working to secure a new provider, we propose: • Increasing school adjustment counseling to 45 minutes weekly when an outside therapist is unavailable • Adding consultation time between school and outside providers once a new therapist is secured • Adding weekly social-emotional learning group 5. Enhanced accommodations including flexible arrival times, structured break protocols, and a formal reintegration plan following absences Ms. Sampson has asked if she and Heaven could please have an opportunity to visit Renaissance school before making a final decision on school assignment. This week, Ms. Sampson is available on Thursday. I have no reason to be concerned that they might change their minds about the requested school assignment, but a visit prior to making a final commitment would help manage Heaven's already significant anxiety. This also might be a good opportunity for Heaven to meet her new adjustment counselor. I suggest we work on finalizing the IEP, arranging a visit, and drafting the settlement agreement in parallel. Please let me know your thoughts. Best, Andrew",[IEP revision requests attachment],"Detailed email responding to proposed IEP with specific requested changes to goals, services, and accommodations.

I would never deny a professional courtesy that was not materially adverse to my Student's interests.  Our grounds for objecting to the District's request are as follows:
1.	Without seeing the District's reply, we cannot potentially narrow the additional discovery we need to serve in time to address any discovery issues prior to the December 16 hearing. If the reply were served on 11/14, the day after the settlement conference, and I served discovery on 11/15, discovery would be due on the day of the hearing.
2.	We already have one round of discovery that has been outstanding for more than 30 days (I haven’t calculated the assented-to tolling, which could affect that assertion).
3.	To date, the Student has every reason to be pessimistic about the settlement conference.
4.	Most importantly, Heaven has essentially stopped attending school due to her anxiety and other health issues.  Additionally, she just lost her health insurance and has been cut off from her therapy.  This loss of external support makes her current educational situation even more precarious and increases the urgency of addressing her needs within the school setting.  Any delay in addressing her placement/school assignment and services could result in further educational harm, especially given her lack of access to outside therapeutic resources.  The District may need to consider providing additional support services in light of this development.  The urgency of her situation cannot be overstated.
5.	The District has consistently delayed addressing Heaven's needs, from the initial refusal to find her eligible in June to the delayed provision of the IEP in September.  Further delay primarily benefits the District rather than Heaven, and could be particularly detrimental given her current lack of therapeutic support.
6.	We are prepared to move forward with the hearing as scheduled to ensure Heaven receives appropriate support as soon as possible. This is especially critical now that she lacks the safety net of external therapy and healthcare resources.
7.	Additionally, we have not received any response from the District regarding our request for an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE). This lack of response further demonstrates the District's pattern of delay in addressing Heaven's educational needs, which is particularly concerning given her current vulnerable state.
Alisia, I asked you this in a separate email a minute before I received Alina's email, but I'd like to confer with you prior to deciding whether or not to assent.
As an aside, and I have not looked into this at all, but I am wondering if a Hearing Officer has the discretion to extend the statutory deadline for a reply without the other party's assent.

I am writing to formally request professional documentation regarding Heaven Sampson's mental health needs as they relate to her educational environment.

On August 29, 2024, during Heaven's IEP eligibility meeting, Heaven’ CHD therapist voiced her opinion that Heaven's PTSD symptoms are triggered by exposure to Kiley Middle School.  Without written documentation of this professional assessment, our recent request to the special education appeals hearing officer lacked crucial support.  As a result, the hearing officer denied our request to order Heaven's school reassignment, citing the absence of a mental health professional's written statement regarding Heaven's specific needs.

Heaven's current situation as I understand it is as follows:
1.	She frequently experiences severe anxiety on school mornings, often preventing her attendance.
2.	When she does attend, she suffers panic attacks throughout the day, necessitating her leaving class.
3.	These issues persist despite the in-school supports and therapy services in place.

To address Heaven's educational needs effectively, we require a written professional opinion that includes:
1.	An assessment of Heaven's PTSD symptoms in relation to her current school environment.
2.	Specific recommendations for educational accommodations or placement changes that would benefit Heaven's mental health and academic progress.

This documentation is essential for several reasons:
1.	It will provide the necessary support for our request to the hearing officer.
2.	It will help ensure that Heaven receives appropriate educational services and placement.
3.	It aligns with ethical standards for mental health professionals, which include advocacy for patients' needs beyond the clinical setting when necessary for their well-being.

To illustrate the importance of this request, consider these analogies: Would an endocrinologist hesitate to provide documentation about a diabetic student's need leave his classroom for insulin administration during school hours?  Or would an oncologist hesitate to provide information about a young cancer patient's need for a shorter school day due to limited stamina from her treatment?  Mental health needs deserve the same level of professional advocacy and documentation as physical health conditions.

We respectfully request that CHD provide this documentation by Friday, October 18.  If there are any concerns or if further discussion is needed, I am available for a phone call at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  We look forward to working collaboratively to support Heaven's mental health and educational needs.

Regards, 

Andrew Sirulnik

Hi Nicole and Katelyn,
Thanks for the email. I appreciate the offer to provide basic information, but the hesitation to provide a detailed professional opinion is harming Heaven.  Each day without a detailed statement about how Heaven’s school assignment impacts her mental health leaves Heaven's critical mental health and educational needs unmet.  As you know, Heaven is suffering.
The ACA and APA Codes of Ethics (attached) require mental health clinicians to acknowledge in writing a client's mental health care needs when necessary to protect the client's mental health. Specifically, ACA Code A.7.a requires clinicians to advocate on behalf of their clients to address barriers to client growth.  Additionally, ACA Code A.1.a mandates promoting client welfare as the primary responsibility, and APA Principle A emphasizes beneficence and non-maleficence.  
Withholding crucial information about Heaven's needs impedes her access to appropriate educational services and placement and, if I understand you correctly, is harmful to Heaven's mental health.  Refusing to provide information necessary for Heaven's well-being is a violation of the profession’s codes of ethics.
As Heaven's advocate, I have my own ethical obligation to advocate for her best interests.  You and I share a professional duty to help protect and promote Heaven's welfare.  By working together and providing comprehensive information about Heaven's needs, we can fulfill our shared ethical responsibilities and make sure she receives the support and accommodations she needs at school.
To fulfill your ethical obligations and serve Heaven's best interests, a more detailed letter is needed.  This letter should include:
1.	Your professional opinion of Heaven's psychological needs related to her education

2.	Recommendations regarding school placement and accommodations

3.	How Heaven's diagnosis and treatment impact her learning and behavior

Providing this information is essential for Heaven's welfare and aligns with your ethical obligations as Heaven’s mental health clinician.  I am only asking for your good-faith professional opinion based solely on your own clinical knowledge of Heaven's situation.  We need that to get Heaven into an appropriate educational setting.

Please help me help Heaven by moving this forward promptly.  I'm available to discuss this further with you if you have any questions or concerns about providing a written opinion as to Heaven’s mental health care needs at school.

Thanks for your consideration, 

Andrew

DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW APPEALS
BUREAU OF SPECIAL EDUCATION APPEALS
In Re: Heaven Sampson v. Springfield Public Schools
BSEA #2414829
STUDENT'S RESPONSE TO DISTRICT'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
Now comes the Student, Heaven Sampson, by and through her attorney, and hereby opposes the
District's Motion for Protective Order. As grounds for this opposition, the Student states:
1. On June 12, 2024, the District held a special education eligibility meeting and found the Student
ineligible for special education.
2. On June 15, 2024, Student filed a BSEA Hearing Request contesting, inter alia, the District’s
finding of ineligibility.
3. On July 1, 2024, Student filed her first Amended Hearing request in this proceeding,
4. On August 24, Student served interrogatories and requests for production of documents on the
District.
5. On August 29, 2024, the District reconvened an IEP eligibility meeting for the Student and found
her eligible for Special Education, reversing its June 12, 2024 decision and mooting the eligibility
claims that largely formed the basis of the then-operative Amended Hearing Request.
6. On September 3, the District served its Motion for Protective Order, contending that some of
the August 24 discovery requests were no longer relevant because of the August 29 finding of
eligibility.
7. On September 4, prior to the start of business, the undersigned acknowledged to the District
and Hearing Officer via email that the District’s August 29th finding of eligibility mooted the issue
underlying some of the outstanding discovery requests.
8. On September 13, the Student filed her second amended hearing request, in order to address
new allegations of procedural violations and ongoing FAPE deprivations, as well as alleged child
find violations. This amended request withdrew eligibility claims that had been mooted by the
District’s August 29 reversal of its June 12 finding of ineligibility.
Page 2 of 6
9. In light of the amended hearing request removing the mooted eligibility claims, the Student
hereby withdraws the following discovery requests: Document Requests: 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,
25; Interrogatories: 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 21, 22.
10. The remaining discovery requests at issue remain relevant to the claims raised in the Second
Amended Hearing Request, as detailed below:
(i) Document Requests:
# 12: Still relevant to claims regarding staff training on IEP development (¶17(b),
17(c) of Amended Request)
# 27: Still relevant to child find claims (¶37, 38, 39, 40, 41 of Amended Request)
# 29: Still relevant to child find claims and claims regarding evaluation of students
with attendance issues (¶37, 38, 39, 40, 41 of Amended Request)
# 30: Still relevant to claims regarding transportation services (¶11, 17(h) of
Amended Request)
(ii) Interrogatories:
# 16: Still relevant to claims regarding compensatory services (¶IV.6 of Amended
Request)
# 20: Still relevant to claims regarding bullying and its impact on educational needs
(¶3, 4, 42(c) of Amended Request)
# 24: Still relevant to claims regarding transportation services (¶11, 17(h) of Amended
Request)
11. The Student respectfully submits that these remaining discovery requests are relevant and
proportional to the needs of the case as presented in the Second Amended Hearing Request.
Response to District’s Assertions of Unnecessary Delay by the Parent
12. The District has contended that the Parent is prolonging this case unnecessarily and has
threatened to seek recovery of its legal fees from the Parent or the undersigned counsel. This
contention is without merit as it mischaracterizes the sequence of events and ignores the
District's own role in delaying the resolution of this case.
13. As alleged in the Second Amended Hearing Request, the District acknowledged no later than
January 11, 2024 that the Student has a physical or mental health condition that had become an
ongoing, significant barrier to her ability to attend school, yet the District took no steps to
Page 3 of 6
evaluate the Student or provide accommodations or services, as mandated by child find
provisions of Section 504 and the IDEA.
14. On June 12, 2024, the District had an opportunity to find Heaven eligible for special education
services based on the evaluation it had conducted, but it refused to do so.
15. On June 13, Student, through counsel, advised the District to reconsider its decision, noting that
Student likely would request a due process hearing if the District failed to reconsider.
16. The District responded by offering to reconsider eligibility the following school year based on a
future independent evaluation.
17. On June 15, Student filed her initial hearing request challenging the ineligibility determination.
18. On June 17, Student advised the District of its obligation to find Heaven eligible and develop an
IEP. Nevertheless, the District refused to reconsider its determination until the following school
year.
19. On August 29, 2024, during the first week of school, the District reconvened an eligibility
meeting and found Heaven eligible for special education. This reversal was made without
explanation or justification, as no additional evaluation had been conducted. This suggests that
the it is the District's initial refusal to find Heaven eligible that was unreasonable, not the
Parent's pursuit of appropriate services for her child.
20. This apparently arbitrary two-and-a-half-month delay resulted in Heaven being deprived of
special education services over the summer while attending District's summer school and at the
beginning of the 2024-2025 school year.
21. Even after finding Heaven eligible on August 29, 2024, the District failed to provide a proposed
IEP within the legally required timeframe, further delaying the provision of necessary services.
22. As detailed in the Second Amended Hearing Request, the District's failure to provide a timely IEP
and implement agreed-upon accommodations has resulted in ongoing deprivations of FAPE and
further delayed the resolution of the dispute.
23. The District denies that it unreasonably delayed providing a proposed IEP, asserting that it
provided the parent with a proposed IEP ""within 10 school days as required"" (Opposition, ¶ 3).
24. The District appears to have relied on a misapplication of the DESE memorandum,
""Memorandum on the Implementation of 603 CMR 28.05(7): Parent Response to Proposed IEP
and Proposed Placement,"" dated December 1, 2006 (attached hereto as App. 1) (""Guidance"").
25. This Guidance notes that ""Since 2000, an IEP provided to a parent within 3–5 days of the Team
meeting fulfills the requirement for 'immediate' delivery of the IEP to the parent"" but that
Page 4 of 6
waiting up to two calendar weeks to provide the IEP is permissible to DESE provided that the
district provides a written summary at the end of the meeting. The written summary must
include:
(i) A completed IEP service delivery grid describing the types and amounts of special
education and/or related services proposed by the district, and
(ii) A statement of the major goal areas associated with these services.
26. In the Student's case, however, the District failed to provide any written or oral information
concerning the IEP meeting agreements at all prior to delivering the proposed IEP. It took the
District two weeks and a day to provide (a few hours after Student filed her motion for
Preliminary Injunction) a partially illegible version of a proposed IEP, and an additional four days
to provide a fully legible version.
27. In its July 10, 2024 Memorandum, the District stated it had agreed to write an IEP for the
Student, rendering the motion for summary judgment moot.
28. However, in her Ruling on Student's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, the Hearing Officer
""decline[d] to address the District's argument that the issue of eligibility is moot due to the
District's offer of an IEP for Student for the purposes of resolution"" as ""none [had] been
proposed."" (Ruling on Student's Mot. for Partial Summary Decision, July 24, 2024, n.34)
29. In its Motion for Protective Order, the District repeated its assertion that the Parent was
unnecessarily protracting the case, along with a threat to seek attorney's fees from the Parent
and Student's undersigned counsel:
As [counsel for the District] expressed during the [August 7, 2024] PHC, it continues to
be the District's position that the Parent is prolonging this case unnecessarily after the
District has offered full resolution of the Parent's claims. This is resulting in legal
expenses to the District and time now to be spent responding to discovery. ... The
District continues to put the Parent on notice that it reserves its right to seek attorney's
fees from the Parent and [the Student’s counsel] for unnecessary protraction of this
matter.
Motion for Protective Order, Sept. 3, 2024, at pg. 3.
30. It is important to note that the District's offer to find the Student eligible was contingent upon
the Parent executing a full, general release of any and all claims related to education from the
Student's initial enrollment to the execution of the Agreement.
31. Therefore, the District's assertion that it ""has offered full resolution of the Parent's claims"" is
selective, and its repeated allegations of unnecessary delay by the Parent and threats to seek
Page 5 of 6
attorney's fees from the undersigned and Student's mother on this basis are unfounded and
concerning.
32. Before the start of business on September 4, 2024, the third business day after the meeting at
which the District had finally found Heaven eligible for special education, and within 24 hours of
first receiving written confirmation of the same, the undersigned counsel timely acknowledged
to the District and Hearing Officer via email that the District had mooted the eligibility issue and
that a second motion to amend the hearing request would be forthcoming. See Ex. A.
Conclusion
33. The remaining discovery requests are crucial for addressing the ongoing issues of FAPE
deprivation, child find violations, and the need for compensatory services as outlined in the
Second Amended Hearing Request. These requests are directly relevant to the current disputes
and are necessary for a fair and comprehensive resolution of this case in accordance with the
IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA. The Student respectfully submits that allowing these discovery
requests is essential to protect her rights and ensure she receives the appropriate educational
services and accommodations to which she is entitled under the law.
34. The District's assertions of unnecessary delay by the Parent are unfounded and ignore the
District's own role in prolonging this matter. The Student has acted in good faith throughout this
process, promptly acknowledging when an issue became moot and amending her hearing
request accordingly. The District's threats to seek attorney's fees, in light of its own delays and
actions, are concerning and potentially violate Section 504's prohibition against retaliation,
intimidation, and interference.

WHEREFORE, the Student respectfully requests that this Honorable Bureau:
A. Deny the District's Motion for Protective Order with respect to the remaining discovery
requests identified above;
B. Grant such other relief as the Bureau deems just and proper.
Respectfully submitted,
Heaven Sampson

STUDENT’S MOTION TO AMEND HEARING REQUEST

Now comes Heaven Sampson (""Student""), by and through her mother and next friend, Samantha Sampson, and her court-appointed special education advocate, Andrew Sirulnik, Esq., and respectfully moves the Hearing Officer to allow the Student's Hearing Request to be amended as set forth in the proposed Amended Hearing Request, attached hereto.

In support of this motion, the Student states:

	•	The Student filed her initial Hearing Request on June 15, 2024.
	•	The Student seeks to amend the Hearing Request to request an extended evaluation as part of the requested relief, as described in counsel for the Student's email to counsel for the District on June 24, 2024. See Exhibit ""A"".
	•	The proposed amendments include:
	•	Adding a request for an extended evaluation to the proposed resolution;
	•	Modifying the issues presented to focus on the District's policy or standard operating procedure regarding eligibility determinations, rather than on a confirmed District policy;

Page 1 of 3


	•	Adjusting the proposed resolution to align with the modified issues presented.
	•	The request for an extended evaluation was not included in the initial hearing request because such a request is typically predicated on finding a student eligible for special education services, which the District has refused to do in this case. Upon further consideration, the Student believes it is appropriate to include this request as part of the overall relief sought, given the complexities of Heaven's needs and the District's misapplication of eligibility criteria.
	•	The modification to the issues presented is necessary to more accurately reflect the current state of information regarding the District's practices. While the Student maintains that the District has misapplied eligibility criteria in this case, the amendment seeks to address whether this misapplication is part of a broader policy or standard operating procedure, rather than asserting a confirmed District-wide policy.
	•	BSEA Hearing Rule I(G) allows amendments to hearing requests if the other party consents in writing, or if the Hearing Officer grants permission (provided such permission is not granted later than five (5) calendar days before the start of the hearing). The rule further states that whenever a hearing request is amended, the entire process starts over for the purpose of timelines, as if the amended hearing request were a new request.
Granting leave to amend the Hearing Request would not prejudice any party, as SPS has not yet filed its response to the initial Hearing Request. Moreover, allowing the amendment would serve the interests of justice and administrative efficiency by enabling all issues to be addressed in a single proceeding.
WHEREFORE, the Student respectfully requests that the Hearing Officer ALLOW this motion and permit the Student to proceed on the Amended Hearing Request attached hereto.


Respectfully submitted, Heaven Sampson

	•	FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

	•	Heaven is a fourteen-year-old seventh grade student who resides in Springfield, Massachusetts and attends Kiley Middle School within SPS.

	•	On April 7, 2024, the undersigned referred Heaven for an initial special education evaluation based on a suspected emotional disability that was severely limiting her access to the general curriculum.

	•	On April 25, 2024, SPS convened a meeting to discuss Heaven's school attendance issues and developed a ""Safety Plan"" for Heaven.

	•	The April 25, 2024 Safety Plan included door-to-door transportation to address the impact of Heaven's emotional disability on her ability to get to school.

	•	On May 23, 2024, SPS convened a Section 504 pre-placement meeting and found Heaven eligible for a Section 504 Plan based on an emotional disability (anxiety). SPS developed a Section 504 Plan stating:

Heaven's anxiety significantly affects her ability to engage in learning activities. She experiences physical and somatic symptoms that interfere with her concentration and ability to come to school. At this time, Heaven currently has 83 current absences. Heaven's attendance and academic performance are notably affected by her anxiety, particularly during transportation to and from school. The anxiety she experiences on the bus has resulted in challenges with attendance and engagement.

	•	The May 23, 2024 Section 504 Plan listed counseling as a Related Service.


	•	Between April and June 2024, the District conducted special education evaluations as part of an initial special education eligibility determination, including an academic assessment, psychological assessment, and Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA).

	•	On June 12, 2024, SPS convened an IEP Team meeting to review the evaluations and make an eligibility determination.

	•	At the June 12, 2024 meeting, the Team found that Heaven has an emotional disability that meets the criteria for eligibility under the IDEA.

	•	The Team also found that Heaven's emotional disability adversely impacts her access to education, as evidenced by:

	•	Heaven only attending school about one day or fewer days per week before the counseling and door-to-door transportation services were put in place;
	•	Heaven only attending school 2-3 days per week even with counseling and door-to-door transportation services in place; and,
	•	Heaven performing years behind grade level in math.

	•	The Team further found that Heaven requires a continuation of the counseling and special door-to-door transportation service to access the general education curriculum due to the impact of her disability.

	•	Despite these findings, the Team determined that Heaven does not qualify for an Individualized Education Program (IEP) because she does not require specially designed instruction (SDI) at this time.

	•	The District concluded it could meet Heaven's needs through her existing 504 Plan rather than an IEP.


	•	On June 13, 2024, the undersigned presented SPS with controlling legal authority demonstrating that the Team's refusal to find Heaven eligible for an IEP was based on an erroneous application of special education law.

	•	SPS nonetheless maintains that the need for transportation as a related service does not qualify a child for an IEP in the absence of a concurrent need for specially designed instruction.

	•	SPS has not reconsidered its eligibility determination for Heaven..

	•	The consequence of this misapplication of the law for Heaven is that she is deprived of the full procedural rights and protections of the IDEA solely because the District, in its opinion, can adequately meet her needs through Section 504 accommodations rather than special education services.

	•	The District's approach of finding students ineligible for IEPs based solely on a lack of need for specially designed instruction, even when they require related services to access the general curriculum, directly impacts Heaven's educational rights and opportunities. By denying Heaven eligibility for an IEP despite her need for related services to access the general curriculum, the District is:
	•	Depriving Heaven of the procedural safeguards provided by the IDEA, including but not limited to the right to prior written notice of proposed changes to her educational program, the stay-put provision during disputes, and the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense;
	•	Limiting Heaven's access to special education services that may become necessary as her needs evolve, potentially delaying or denying appropriate interventions;
	•	Reducing the frequency and depth of monitoring and assessment of Heaven's educational progress, as 504 Plans typically involve less rigorous oversight than IEPs;


	•	Potentially impacting Heaven's access to transition planning and services as she approaches secondary education, as these are mandated under the IDEA but not Section 504.


	•	LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The IDEA defines a ""child with a disability"" as a child who has one of the enumerated disabling conditions (including serious emotional disturbance) ""who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services."" 20 USC §1401(3)(A).

Massachusetts special education regulations provide that a student is eligible for an IEP if:

the student has one or more of the disabilities defined at 603 CMR 28.02(7) and if, as a result of the disability(ies), the student is unable to progress effectively in the general education program without the provision of specially designed instruction, or is unable to access the general curriculum without the provision of one or more related services.

603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(1). (Emphasis added).

The regulation goes on to state that if the student meets either of these criteria. “the Team shall determine that the student is eligible.” 603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(1). (Emphasis added)


Massachusetts special education regulations incorporate the federal definition of ""related services"" from 34 CFR § 300.34, which specifically includes counseling services and transportation services among the related services that can independently establish IEP eligibility. 603 CMR 28.02(18).

The regulations further provide:

Upon determining that the student is eligible for special education, the Team shall develop an IEP using the evaluation data to guide development of goals and objectives for the student.

603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(3). (Emphasis added)

The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education's choice of the word “shall” rather than “may” is controlling in both 603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(1) and 603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(3). This mandatory language requires the Team to find the student eligible and develop an IEP if the student meets either of the prongs laid out in 603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(1)--inability to progress effectively without specially designed instruction or inability to access the curriculum without related services.


	•	ISSUE PRESENTED
	•	Whether SPS applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that Heaven does not qualify as an ""eligible student"" for an IEP under the IDEA and MGL c. 71B.
	•	Whether it is SPS policy or standard operating procedure to find students who have one or more of the disabilities defined at 603 CMR 28.02(7) and, as a result, are unable to access the general curriculum without the provision of one or more related services ineligible for special education if such students do not require specially designed instruction.
	•	If the answer to (1) or (2) is in the affirmative, what individual remedies are appropriate to ensure Heaven receives the full


substantive and procedural rights and protections of the IDEA and MGL c. 71B on an ongoing basis?

	•	PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Heaven requests that the BSEA:
	•	Find that SPS incorrectly determined that Heaven was ineligible for special education services.
	•	Find that Heaven meets the criteria for eligibility as a student with a disability who requires related services in order to access the general education curriculum, pursuant to 603 CMR
28.05(2)(a)(2).
	•	Order SPS to promptly reconvene Heaven's IEP Team to develop an appropriate IEP and placement for the remainder of the
2023-2024 school year, including extended school year (ESY)
services as needed, and for the 2024-2025 school year.
	•	Order SPS to fund an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) in the areas of academic achievement, cognition, and social/emotional functioning, as the parent disagrees with the district's evaluation based on its insufficient information for developing an appropriate IEP. 34 CFR 300.502(b).
	•	Order SPS to conduct an extended evaluation, including independent neuropsychological, behavioral, clinical psychology and psychiatry, and trauma-focused evaluations, to collect data to support the development of a complete IEP. 603 CMR 28.05(2)(b). The extended evaluation shall not be used to delay or deny programs or services determined to be necessary by the Team.
	•	Issue a ruling that SPS's policy of refusing to find students eligible for special education based solely on a need for related services violates the IDEA and MGL c. 71B, and order SPS to apply the


correct legal standard in all future eligibility determinations for Heaven Sampson.

	•	Order any other remedies deemed appropriate by the Hearing Officer.

Alisia,

Please convey our response to the district regarding Dr. McCarthy’s question about our expectations and reasoning for requesting evaluations by specialists in adolescent clinical psychology and psychiatry.

The clinical psychology and psychiatric evaluations are crucial for several reasons. While Heaven has a preliminary diagnosis of PTSD from her initial intake at CHD, comprehensive clinical psychology and psychiatric evaluations can provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of her condition. This may include identifying any co-occurring disorders or specific subtypes of anxiety that are impacting her educational performance. Additionally, these evaluations will provide:

Valuable insights into how Heaven's mental health conditions specifically affect her ability to access and benefit from her education. This is particularly important given her significant attendance issues and the anxiety related to school attendance.

Recommendations for evidence-based treatments that may be necessary for Heaven to fully access her education. This could include specific types of therapy, potential medication considerations, or other interventions that might be classified as related services under IDEA.

Detailed recommendations for accommodations and modifications that may be necessary in the school environment.

Important baseline data on Heaven's current functioning, which will be valuable for developing goals and objectives to monitor her progress and adjust her educational program as needed.

These evaluations are necessary to fully understand Heaven's needs and to develop an appropriate educational program. As per 603 CMR 28.05(2)(b), if the Team finds the current evaluation information insufficient to develop a complete IEP, an extended evaluation period may be appropriate. We suggest that these clinical psychology and psychiatric evaluations be considered as part of such an extended evaluation.

The District should be aware that 603 CMR 28.05(2)(b) expressly provides, ""The extended evaluation period shall not be used to deny programs or services determined to be necessary by the Team."" The Team's unanimous conclusion on 6/13/2024 that Heaven meets the criteria for eligibility created an immediate and ongoing obligation for the District to develop at least a partial IEP with the currently

available information. The District is required by law to develop and propose this partial IEP without further delay. This partial IEP must be implemented immediately upon parental consent, even while the extended evaluation is occurring. The results of the additional evaluations can then be used to revise and complete the IEP as needed. We expect the District to comply with its obligations promptly.

Please let me know if your client needs any further information or clarification.

Best regards, Andrew

Hello,

The IEP Team determined that Heaven does not require specialized instruction; therefore, she was found ineligible and referred to the 504 team. The District understands you are appealing the Finding of No Eligibility. We would like to reconvene as a team to discuss your concerns, along with reviewing any completed IEEs, when staff and students return in August. The District is proposing the IEP team reconvene on Tuesday, August 27, 2024, at 10:00 AM. A Team meeting invitation has been sent home. The team cannot meet prior to June 28th as staff and students are out on summer vacation.

The District has sent IEE paperwork for all areas previously assessed. In reference to your request for a psychiatric evaluation, will you please share with us what you are looking for with this type of evaluation?

Box 1410 Springfield, MA 01103-1410 THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST'S REPORT PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION *CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION* Student Name: Heaven Sampson  School: Kiley Academy Middle School  Date of Birth: 5/14/2010  Student ID#:  124246  Age: 14 years Omonths  Date of Assessment: 5/24/2024  Grade: 7th  School Psychologist: Dr. Calli Dushman  REASON FOR REFERRAL/REFERRAL QUESTION: Heaven was referred for an initial evaluation at the school's request to obtain a current assessment of intellectual functioning for educational planning purposes and to determine if a disability exists for Special Education. This assessment will review current cognitive and academic skills including Heaven's strengths and weaknesses. The results of this assessment will assist the IEP team in determining if a disability significantly impacts Heaven's academic progress. Recent educational support and interventions will also be examined to determine effectiveness and utility. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Educational: Heaven is a 14-year-old student currently attending the 7th grade at Kiley Academy Middle School. Based on a review of the records held by the Springfield Public Schools with reference to academic functioning, Heaven is being evaluated for an initial evaluation. Records indicate that Heaven first enrolled in Springfield Public Schools in August of 2015 for Kindergarten. For the 2022-2023 school year, Heaven had a total of 16 unexcused absences and for the current 2023-2024 school year, Heaven has a total of61 unexcused absences as of 5/24/2024. Her grades for the current school year are as follows, Art-A, Crew-F, Engineering Essentials -F, English -F, Math-D-, Science-F, and Social Studies-A. The reader is referred to Heaven's cumulative file for a fuller review of her history. Background information was obtained through a review of cumulative files, a review of records, a parent interview, and an informal interview with Heaven during the evaluation session. Parent Interview: An interview was conducted with Heaven's mother, Samantha Sampson. Ms. Sampson reported that Heaven has not been attending school as much due to the bullying incident which occurred in the fall. Heaven has been having difficult attending school due to the anxiety in entails and she has trouble sleeping at night ass well. Heaven currently sees a counselor through BHN. Prior to the bullying incident, Heaven had good grades and was a good student. OBSERVATIONS: Assessment Observations: Heaven met with this school psychologist for two test sessions, over the course of one day. She willingly accompanied the examiner to the evaluation space, and she was seen walking appropriately throughout the hallways. Heaven reported her favorite subject is ELA and her most difficult subject is Math. In her leisure time, Heaven reported she enjoys playing video games such as Call of Duty. When Heaven grows up, she hopes to become a pediatric surgeon. When asked about the bullying incidents at school, Heaven reported the situation has gotten better since being on a new bus, however she reported sometimes it is difficult for her to attend school due to the anxiety it brings. Throughout all evaluations, Heaven put her best effort into the testing and wanted to be successful. She was able to follow single-step directions and multi-step directions with repetition. During the evaluation session, Heaven made adequate eye contact. Her frustration tolerance was good, even when attempting the more difficult items. Throughout the evaluation, Heaven was observed second guessing herself when answering the questions. Heaven was able to sustain attention throughout my evaluation. The testing was completed in two test sessions over the course of one day (lasting approximately 2 hours). The reader should consider the results of testing as part of a review of Heaven's cognitive, academic, and social emotional functioning across setting and through time. These scores are a snapshot of current functioning in a sample of time and should be reviewed in the context of all other data. In the opinion of the examiner, Heaven scores are a valid estimate of her present abilities.

Functional Behavior Assessment Summary *confidential*
(November 2021)

Student Name: Heaven Sampson
Student ID: 124246
School: The Academy at Kiley
Grade: 7th
Current Educational Placement: Gen Ed
Date: 05/31/2024

PURPOSE: A Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) is used to gather information about a student's behavior to determine the need for, and provide the foundation for, a Behavioral Support Plan (BSP). An FBA is required to be conducted if the student's violation of a code of conduct (resulting in a change of placement) is determined to be a manifestation of the student's disability. ** This assessment is only to be used for educational decision making and should not be disseminated nor the information within shared with those not directly involved with behavior support planning for the student.

Team Members Participating:
Milena Cruzado, School Counselor
Mayanh Forbes, English Teacher
Felix Perez, Science Teacher
Amber O'Reilly, Engineering Teacher

Relevant Background:
Heaven resides with her mother and siblings and often spends time with her grandmother. Heaven was found eligible for a 504 Plan on 5/23/24 for a suspected diagnosis of Anxiety. Heaven recently completed an intake with CHD school-based therapy. She has not engaged in counseling services since slots are full but is pending to start. She also has a referral through CHD to meet with a Therapeutic Mentor. Heaven has a preliminary diagnosis of PTSD upon intake session. Heaven is scheduled to see a Psychiatrist for an appointment on July 10, 2024.

During the 30-day FBA observation period, Heaven had 5 excused absences and 10 unexcused absences. On the days Heaven was at school, no behaviors of concern were observed. In the parent feedback FBA survey, Mom noted that she often feels anxious before school, during school, and sometimes when she first gets home. When Heaven is out in public with her family, she gets nervous, thinking people might see who has an issue with her, and notes she's not allowed to go anywhere alone. The parent reported that school is a trigger since Heaven often gets nervous, experiences somatic symptoms (e.g., upset stomach, heart racing), and gets hot and fidgets with her hands.

Heaven reported in her student reinforcement survey, ""At school, I'd like to spend more time with: Best Friends. Some things I'd like to do with this person are: Go walk outside together."" When asked, ""I feel great at school when,"" Heaven reported, ""I don't know,"" but stated that she doesn't like school-too long of a day. She reported to the open-ended response, ""The thing that upsets me the most is: Student's talking all at once. It makes her anxious, and it's a lot to keep up with.""

Heaven participates in General Education. Her English, Math, and Health classes have 17 students, Science has 14 students, and Engineering Essentials has 9 students.

Target Behavior # 1

Description of Behavior 1: Compliance is defined as engaging in a response that matches the delivered instruction within 30 seconds from when the instruction was given and completing the request. Examples: Quietly working on the activity at the desk during independent work time, watching teacher/tracking speaker during lesson/instruction. Heaven finishes work and participates in free time. Beginning independent work once instructions are given. Non-examples: Talking to peers during independent work time. Starting out the window or looking at students other than the speaker. Students finish work and talk to a peer or play on the computer. Working on independent work before the teacher approved starting.

Setting Event(s)

Behavior 1: Compliance
Heaven complies with classroom norms and expectations across all class periods. The data collection was based on Teacher charted data collection and direct observation.
• Crew (AM/PM)-27%
• Math-15%
• Lunch-23%
• Science 12%
• Engineering Essentials 19%
• Career & Social Skills -4%
*Interpret data cautiously as this data was collected over 11 school days, and Heaven was absent for 4 days. Percentages are based on observed classes/teacher data received.

Antecedent(s)

Behavior 1: Compliance
• Crew 1:1 Social Emotional check-in -(24%)
▶ Received permission from Crew teacher to visit another Crew (10%)
• Talking to friends before instruction (10%)
• Independent work time (10%)
• Teacher-provided instruction (7%)
• Transition between tasks (4%)
• Teacher attention 1:1 (28%)
• Group Activity-Jeopardy Game (7%)
*Interpret data cautiously as this data was collected over 11 school days, and Heaven was absent for 4 days. Percentages are based on observed classes/teacher data received.

Consequence(s)
* Information from direct observation and data collection
* Include percentage of occurrences(%)
* See the FBA Guide Appendix for examples and graphing instructions.

Behavior 1: Compliance
• Teacher 1:1 help/support (2)
• No consequence needed (6)
• Group work redirection (3)
*Interpret data cautiously as this data was collected over 11 school days, and Heaven was absent for 4 days. Percentages are based on observed classes/teacher data received.

Hypothesis of Behavioral Function

Behavior 1: Compliance
Heaven will likely engage in compliance behaviors during classroom activities, such as quietly working on activities at her desk during independent work time or tracking the teacher/speaker during lessons. Consequences for compliance include teacher 1:1 help/support, group work redirection, or no specific consequence needed. Therefore, the function of the behavior could be automatic reinforcement, where Heaven finds intrinsic satisfaction or fulfillment in following instructions and participating in class activities. This behavior will likely occur during independent and group work time across all settings.

NOTE: If after the implementation of behavior strategies, the behavior is not changing in desirable ways, additional data should be collected to generate a possible alternative hypothesized function

In Re: Heaven Sampson v. Springfield Public Schools 
BSEA #2414829

MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Now comes the Student, Heaven Sampson, by and through her mother and next friend, Samantha Sampson, and respectfully moves the BSEA for a preliminary injunction ordering the Springfield Public Schools (""SPS"" or ""District"") to immediately place Heaven at either Renaissance School or STEM Middle School, pending the outcome of this due process hearing. As grounds for this motion, the Student states:
1.	Heaven Sampson is a 14-year-old 8th grade student with diagnosed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) that significantly impact her ability to attend school and access her education. See Affidavit of Heaven Sampson, ¶¶ 1-2.
2.	Despite being found eligible for special education services on August 29, 2024, Springfield Public Schools has failed to develop an appropriate IEP, consider alternative placements for Heaven, or provide Heaven's mother with a proposed IEP within the timeframe required by law.
3.	As of September 13, 2024, over two weeks after the August 29, 2024 eligibility meeting, SPS has failed to provide Heaven's mother with a proposed IEP, in violation of 603 CMR 28.05(7), which requires the district to provide parents with two copies of the proposed IEP ""immediately following the development of the IEP.""
4.	It is apparent that Heaven's teachers and school administrators also have not received an IEP for Heaven, as they have been denying Heaven crucial accommodations agreed to at the August 29 IEP eligibility meeting.
5.	Heaven's current placement at Kiley Middle School is a source of significant anxiety and trauma triggers, resulting in excessive absences and an inability to access her education. This is evidenced by multiple incidents in the first two weeks of the 2024-2025 school year where Heaven experienced severe anxiety at school, requiring the school to contact her mother for early pickup. See Affidavit of Heaven Sampson, ¶¶ 4-6, 16-17.
6.	Heaven's therapist, Nicole Dean, LMHC, has recommended a change in school placement to reduce anxiety triggers and improve Heaven's ability to attend school regularly. See Affidavit of Heaven Sampson, ¶ 15.
7.	The district has refused to consider suitable alternative placements, despite clear evidence that the current placement is detrimental to Heaven's education and mental health. This refusal was explicitly stated during the August 29, 2024 IEP meeting.
8.	Heaven is suffering irreparable harm each day she remains in an inappropriate placement, including:
a.	Ongoing and worsening anxiety;
b.	Missed instructional time due to absences and anxiety-related early dismissals;
c.	Falling behind academically;
d.	Exposure to bullying and social conflicts that exacerbate her PTSD and anxiety; and,
e.	Lack of consistent implementation of necessary accommodations and supports.
See Affidavit of Heaven Sampson, ¶¶ 7-14.
9.	The balance of harms favors granting the injunction, as the harm to Heaven from remaining in an inappropriate placement far outweighs any administrative burden on the district in changing her school assignment.
10.	The public interest is served by ensuring students with disabilities receive appropriate educational placements and services as required by the IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA.
11.	There is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of Heaven's claims, given the district's clear procedural violations in developing Heaven's IEP and considering placement options, including:
a.	Failing to allow Heaven's mother to participate in the placement determination process;
b.	Refusing to permit the Team to consider placement options;
c.	Failing to consider the potential harmful effects of Heaven's current placement;
d.	Failing to develop measurable annual goals or short-term objectives for Heaven's IEP;
e.	Improperly refusing to consider information provided by Heaven's mental health clinician;
f.	Failing to implement agreed-upon accommodations from Heaven's 504 plan.
See Affidavit of Heaven Sampson, ¶¶ 7-8, 11-14.
BSEA Authority and Legal Standard for Preliminary Injunction:
12.	The Bureau of Special Education Appeals has the authority to issue preliminary injunctions in special education matters. This authority is derived from Massachusetts Special Education Regulation 603 CMR 28.08(7)(c) states that the BSEA has the power to ""order a temporary change in placement of an eligible student for reasons consistent with federal law, including but not limited to when maintaining such student in the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the student or others.""
13.	The legal standard for granting a preliminary injunction is well-established. As stated in Garcia v. Department of Hous. & Cmty. Dev., 480 Mass. 736, 747 (2018) (quoting Loyal Order of Moose, Inc., Yarmouth Lodge #2270 v. Board of Health of Yarmouth, 439 Mass. 597, 601 (2003)), the party seeking a preliminary injunction must show:
a.	A likelihood of success on the merits;
b.	That irreparable harm will result from denial of the injunction; and
c.	That, in light of the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of irreparable harm to the moving party outweighs the potential harm to the nonmoving party in granting the injunction.
14.	Additionally, as noted in Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008), a preliminary injunction is ""an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.""  The moving party must make ""a clear showing of entitlement thereto"" (Student No. 9 v. Board of Educ., 440 Mass. 752, 762 (2004)).
15.	As demonstrated in the preceding paragraphs, Heaven Sampson meets all the criteria for the issuance of a preliminary injunction:
a.	There is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits due to the district's procedural violations and failure to provide FAPE;
b.	Heaven is suffering irreparable harm each day she remains in an inappropriate placement;
c.	The balance of hardships strongly favors Heaven, as the risk of irreparable harm to her outweighs any potential harm to the district in granting the injunction.
16.	Furthermore, granting this injunction serves the public interest by ensuring compliance with special education laws and providing appropriate educational services to students with disabilities.
WHEREFORE, the Student respectfully requests that this Honorable Bureau:
1.	Issue a preliminary injunction ordering Springfield Public Schools to immediately place Heaven Sampson in an appropriate alternative placement, as recommended by Heaven's mental health clinician, such as Renaissance School or STEM Middle School, or another suitable school with the clinician's approval that addresses Heaven's anxiety triggers and educational needs;.
2.	Order the district to provide appropriate transportation to the new school placement;
3.	Order the district to ensure all of Heaven's IEP services and accommodations are implemented at the new placement, including:
a.	Consistent access to counseling support throughout the school day; 
b.	Implementation of the agreed-upon break card system or parent-provided alternative;
c.	Provision of a laptop for home use as specified in her 504 plan;
4.	Order the district to provide Heaven's mother with a proposed IEP within 2 school days of the new placement;
5.	Grant such other relief as the Bureau deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted, 

Heaven Sampson

**************************************

SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC SCHOOLS' OPPOSITION TO PARENT'S MOTION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The Springfield Public Schools (hereinafter ""the District"") hereby opposes Parent's Motion for Injunctive Relief seeking an order for immediate placement at the Renaissance School or STEM Middle School. In support thereof, the District states as follows:

1. Heaven is a 14-year-old 8th grade student at the Kiley Middle School in Springfield. Until a finding of eligibility on August 29, 2024, the District had proposed a 504-plan due to a diagnosis of anxiety that provided Heaven with counseling and specialized transportation.

2. The Parent originally filed for hearing seeking a finding of special education eligibility for Heaven and additional evaluations. The Parent then amended her hearing request asking for an Extended Evaluation. The Parent has not filed a second amended hearing request and recently agreed to a postponement of the scheduled hearing date.

3. The Team met on August 29, 2024 to review completed evaluations and determine eligibility. At this meeting, Heaven was found eligible for special education under the category of Health. The IEP, which was sent to the Parent on September 13 (within 10 school days as required) and then, a corrected version on September 17, includes a goal in math as well as counselor consultation lxl0 min/cycle, and services within the general education setting of math skills (special ed teacher), 1 x30 min/cycle and counseling ( counselor) 1 x 16.25 min/cycle. The proposed placement is full inclusion.

4. Heaven attends school at Kiley Academy. A change to a different school is not a special education change in placement over which the BSEA has jurisdiction. Any parent in Springfield can request a change in school assignment. There is a process that needs to be followed for this.

5. The Parent has not yet responded to the IEP so at this time, Heaven is still a regular education student supported with a 504 plan.

6. The Parent provides no reasoning within her Motion for Injunctive Relief as to why either the Renaissance School or STEM Middle School is a more appropriate school for Heaven to attend from a special education perspective. There is not even an argument that the proposed IEP is not appropriate.

7. Since the start of the 2024-25 school year, Heaven's attendance has been sporadic. She has attended and then indicated she would miss the next few days because she would be feeling anxious.

8. Other than her attendance and her stating that she will feel anxious in the future, there is no evidence that her anxiety or school attendance is related to her [PAGE 2:] assigned school. Even if it were, this is not a special education issue over which the BSEA has jurisdiction.

9. All the claims raised in Parent's Motion are matters of fact. They would require a full due process hearing, including submission of exhibits and testimony of evidence before a Hearing Officer could issue any order even assuming she had jurisdiction over the request, which in this case she does not.

10. It is suggested that Parent may accepted the proposed IEP in order to allow the District to fully support Heaven at school as the Team has proposed.

For these reasons, the District seeks an order DENYING Parent's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.

In Re: Heaven Sampson and
Springfield Public Schools

BSEA # 2414829


STUDENT'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY DECISION


Now comes the Student, Heaven Sampson, by and through her attorney, and moves for partial summary decision pursuant to 801 CMR 1.01(7)(h). In support of this motion, the Student states:

1.	The material facts necessary to decide the issue of Heaven's eligibility for special education are not in dispute, as evidenced by the Student's Amended Hearing Request and the District's Response.

2.	The District admits in its Response that:

a.	Heaven Sampson is a 14-year-old general education rising 8th grade student at Kiley Middle School.

b.	Heaven was found eligible for a 504 plan on or about May 23, 2024 due to anxiety.

c.	Heaven had accumulated 83 absences by April 25, 2024.

d.	The 504 plan provides for counseling and specialized transportation.

e.	The Team met on June 12, 2024, to review the District's evaluations and determine eligibility.

f.	The Team agreed that Heaven meets the criteria for an emotional disability.

g.	The Team concluded that Heaven requires counseling and specialized transportation.

3.	Massachusetts special education regulations at 603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(1) state that a student is eligible for special education if the student has a disability and, as a result of the disability, is ""unable to progress effectively in the general education program without the provision of specially designed instruction, or is unable to access the general curriculum without the provision of one or more related services."" (emphasis supplied)

4.	The District's admissions establish that Heaven meets both prongs of eligibility under 603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(1):

a.	She has a disability (emotional disability), and

b.	She is unable to access the general curriculum without the provision of related services (counseling and specialized transportation).

5.	The regulation further states at 603 CMR 28.05(2)(a)(1) that if the student meets either of these criteria, ""the Team shall determine that the student is eligible."" (emphasis supplied)

6.	Given these undisputed facts and the clear language of the regulation, Heaven is eligible for special education as a matter of law.

7.	The District's stated reason for finding Heaven ineligible – that she does not require specialized instruction – directly contradicts the plain language of the regulation, which explicitly provides for eligibility based on the need for related services alone.  This is not a valid basis for denying eligibility under Massachusetts law when a student requires related services to access the general curriculum.

8.	Summary decision is appropriate in this case because there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding Heaven's disability or her need for related services to access the general curriculum, and the application of the relevant regulation to these undisputed facts entitles the Student to a decision in her favor as a matter of law.

9.	Pursuant to BSEA Hearing Rule VI(B), the Student does not request a hearing on this motion.  The Student believes that the undisputed facts and clear application of law make a hearing unnecessary for the Hearing Officer to rule on this Motion for Partial Summary Decision.

WHEREFORE, the Student requests that the Hearing Officer:

(1)	Enter summary decision in favor of the Student on the issue of whether SPS applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that Heaven does not qualify as an 'eligible student' for an IEP under the IDEA and MGL c. 71B, as set forth in the Student's Amended Hearing Request dated July 1, 2024, at page 7, Section V, paragraph 1. 

(2)	Order the District to find Heaven eligible for special education;

(3)	Order the District to convene the Team within 10 working days, as per the District's summer administrative schedule, or by mutual agreement of the parties, to develop an IEP for Heaven;

(4)	Order any other relief deemed appropriate by the Hearing Officer.

We held off from doing that in 2024, however. Instead, we made two major upgrades to our databases, completed a large-scale restructuring of one of them, performed advocacy regarding the 2024 Title IX regulations, and launched a new advisory service<cr>But we had to do it eventually. Starting on February 12, we will change the pricing structure for all new subscriptions to our three core databases: the Accused Students Database<cr>Summary of Changes<cr>Our plan is to increase the cost for recurring subscription payments for new subscriptions by ~25% but discount the cost of the first cycle by ~30% of the new recurring cost. We believe this new structure will help us accomplish several goals:<cr>1.	Keeping up with our own costs. While have not raised prices since 2018, most of our vendors have raised prices on us. Separately, our costs have also increased as we have improved our databases with nearly three dozen upgrades, many of which provide new features requiring new and costly integrations, more development time, and so forth.<cr>	<cr>	<cr>2.	Respecting our current long-term subscribers. These subscribers helped build us into what we are today. Their contributions funded our advocacy, the continued development of our databases, and the launch of our advisory service. Numerous supporters remain subscribed purely because they believe in our fundamental mission: that Title IX protections should be for all. We will “grandfather” these existing subscribers into the old pricing structure.<cr>	<cr>	<cr>3.	Making it easier for new users to sign up. Many people need to substantially experience a digital service before they can commit more to it financially. Offering 30% off the first cycle of any database subscription for full access accomplishes this goal. It is also fairly easy for us to compromise on the first month’s cost, since on average we will recover that from recurring transactions.<cr>	<cr>	<cr>4.	Funding future development. In one form or another, our databases undergo continuous improvement. We have several new features planned for the Accused Students Database and OCR Resolutions Database in particular, and we will announce them as their development nears completion.<cr>If you would like to be “grandfathered” into the current pricing structure, feel free to sign up to one of the following databases before February 12:<cr>*	Accused Students Database<cr>*	OCR Resolutions Database<cr>*	Attorneys Directory<cr>If you would like to see tables showing the exact changes for each database and subscription type, please read the full ann<cr>Thank you,",,,,2025-05-02 20:54:19,

I'll look those over.<cr>Having looked briefly, it seems that districts face little risk when they fail to follow IEPs. If their liability is limited to providing make-up services by their own staff, and that's only for the small fraction of students who can pursue a BSEA hearing—narrowed further under BSEA practice when students have arguably caught up on their own—then their legal expenses in defending against these claims is an attractive investment, particularly in large and dysfunctional districts. It buys Districts the practical freedom to disregard IEPs so long as they are nominally designed to provide a FAPE. This BSEA practice dramatically shifts the balance of power under the IDEA between students and districts in Massachusetts where the dispute is primarily over comp ed. I imagine this is not news to you.<cr>I'm not sure if Heaven's mom has the inclination to pursue another hearing request, because she is exhausted, and she and her daughter are thrilled with the new school. I hope to discuss it with her this week. Regardless of her decision, it might not be too difficult to find other plaintiffs with similar stories.<cr>Please let me know some good times for a call to discuss.

While we're holding off on pushing for a medical evaluation, I've documented a pattern of the District’s callous indifference that I believe is systemic. I can only imagine how parents with limited means and education who are unrepresented experience this system.<cr>On Monday December 16, Heaven was sick and did not attempt to start at her new school. Rather than arranging the transportation that Heaven would need the next day or when she recovered, Dr. McCarthy dedicated time on Monday to call the Juvenile Court to investigate and attempt to challenge my authority to represent Heaven. We discovered this inverted priority the next day when Heaven, feeling better, waited with a mix of hope and worry for a promised bus to take her to her new school that never came--the transportation company told Heaven's mother that it hadn't been notified of her new school assignment. Her mother, who doesn't own a car, had to pay for an Uber ($12.68) to take Heaven to school, and received a disciplinary reprimand at work for being late.<cr>On January 6, I sent the attached demand seeking comp ed and fees since settlement, copying the incoming and outgoing vice chairs of the school committee. I also let district counsel know that we would need the superintendent at the table for any settlement discussion.<cr>The District's settlement offer just arrived: two hours of counseling time and reimbursement for the $12 uber ride—a ride they had already agreed to reimburse. I'm inclined to recommend we file for a new hearing request and stand firm on a cash fund for comp ed. I know this is done in some jurisdictions, but I'm not aware of it being done in Massachusetts.

Their offer of 2 hours of tutoring and the $12 Uber payment is completely inadequate for all the school days Heaven missed. Also, they already agreed to reimburse you for the Uber. The District failed to do their job of getting Heaven to school, and now they're not stepping up to make it right.<cr>I agree that we should not accept this offer. As I mentioned, I'm considering filing a hearing request about compensation for the missed school days. This would not affect Heaven's current placement at Renaissance – that is secure for this year under our settlement agreement.<cr>One potential strategy would be to use the hearing request as leverage to secure Heaven's placement at Renaissance for next year as well.
